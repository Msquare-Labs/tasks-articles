Plan, organize and collaborate your personal and professional projects with ease. Import tasks from your notes or reminders with a one tap setup.

Tasks don’t always have binary states, they’re not necessarily just `To-do` or `Done`, maybe you’re working on it right now or it’s a pending review. Modern task managers are just digital to-do lists, but your modern life is not so binary. That’s where Tasks can give your productivity a boost!
